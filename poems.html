    <h2>A friend</h2>
    <pre>A word that stands alone,
Yet holds the light, shining bright.
No judgment in gaze, no bitter ends,
Just open hearts—we call it friends.
It starts simple and sweet,
The only excitement: to meet and greet.
From helping escape homework and play,
To making sculptures out of clay.
Every laugh, every tear,
Is forged in fear,
In harmony through waves and tides—
We call it friendship that colors our lives.
No heavy expectations weigh it down,
It’s true friendship we wear as a crown.
Hands held out through sun and rain,
To share the joy, to ease the pain.
It's pure, they say—good and deep,
A promise only souls can keep.
We hold hands through the storms,
To forge a shelter, safe and warm.
In this world of fleeting trends,
What truly lasts?
A friend.</pre>

    <h2>a young life</h2>
    <pre>I found a life; almost 17 years old,
just cooking under the fire of ambitions.
There are questions unanswered.
There are days in trouble—
feels like I’m living in a bubble
on the verge of bursting.

It’s made of diamond crystals,
baked under heat and pressure.

I’m soft inside, with emotions from my mother,
and sharp outside, shaped by my father’s wisdom.

Life sometimes gets boring,
but maybe that’s fine.
His ambitions are high—
he believes he can fly.
The sky felt low,
so he aimed for space.

Fascinated by the mysteries of the universe,
he had some questions—
and some orphan answers.
So, he just put it all in a verse
</pre>

    <h2>open sky</h2>
    <pre>The bird is alone in the blue sky
But, it's flying high with all it's might
It must be it's first flight, or just another one gushing though the soft shiny clouds,
It might be and caught by fear sometimes,
But it's a new adventure all the time.

The view is Surreal and I look up in the sky and wonder if it's real, or just a hallucination,
Whatever be it, never mind, but my mind's imagination has a rhyme.
